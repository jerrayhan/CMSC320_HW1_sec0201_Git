Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is extremely useful in terms of version control, collaboratiion, and management. Especially when working in a team setting, it
effectively combines changes and resolves deltas. It is easily accessible, widely used in different industries, and gives auditability.
I especially like how in each repository, it gives an effective summary of what languages are used within a project, all associated files,
as well as recent changes to all of them. With each commit, you must provide a comment which outlines important changes so that your work
can be properly reviwed and assessed.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: When I think of data science and the 3 V's (Velocity, Volume, and Variety) I instantly think of finance. The finance industry deals
a lot with data, especially when it comes with displaying it. Referencing the Venn Diagram from lecture 1.1, Big Data is extremely useful
in any industry and can be applied to most if not all we do in daily life. I also think about prediction, where this data is used to make
smart decisions on strategy.
