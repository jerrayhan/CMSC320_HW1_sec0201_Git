Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: When I think of data science and the 3 V's (Velocity, Volume, and Variety) I instantly think of finance. The finance industry deals
a lot with data, especially when it comes with displaying it. Referencing the Venn Diagram from lecture 1.1, Big Data is extremely useful
in any industry and can be applied to most if not all we do in daily life. I also think about prediction, where this data is used to make
smart decisions on strategy.
